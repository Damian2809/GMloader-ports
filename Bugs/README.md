## Notes

# Bugs

## GM 2.3 is quite unstable
If the data.win/game.unx is GM2.3, it is less likely to work without patching!

## Missing sound with .ogg files 

Currently, some GameMaker ports with .ogg files (which are use for sound and background music)

**Fix:**
Create a /assets folder with a .gitkeep in the root of your game directory

Add in the following lines into the .sh Script:

		# Check if there are .ogg files in ./gamedata
		if [ -n "$(ls ./gamedata/*.ogg 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
    
			# Move all .ogg files from ./gamedata to ./assets
			mv ./gamedata/*.ogg ./assets/
			echo "Moved .ogg files from ./gamedata to ./assets/"
    
			# Zip the contents of ./sm.apk including the new .ogg files
			zip -r -0 ./sm.apk ./sm.apk ./assets/
			echo "Zipped contents to ./sm.apk"
		fi

## Game has both mouse and keyboard input and controller inputs concurrently active

Open your game in windows and see if there are in-game options to have controller only OR keyboard and mouse input only.
Select the option that you would like i.e contoller and look for an options.ini or save.ini file generated by the game.
Copy over that folder into game/gamedata folder
