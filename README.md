## Notes

### **GameMaker Games**

GameMaker games usually have a data.win, game.unx or game.ios file which contains the main data to make the games work. As the games are not meant to run natively on ARM devices supported by portmaster, it uses gmloader together with an appropriate wrapper (.apk/.port file) to help translate the data into information which can be read by arm devices.

**Note:** the following instructions assumes you already have Portmaster installed on your device. 
It is also a lot more convenient to SSH your files via WIFI to your device rather than physically transferring the data via an SD card reader.

Everything that is called gamename in this Tutorial is the actual gamename of your port. You can always shorten the gamename. Like as a example Super Ultra Sonic 32 Bit Multi -> sus32bitmulti

### **How to port GameMaker games to Portmaster**
1. Download the test.zip from https://github.com/Fraxinus88/GMloader-ports/blob/main/Test/Test_new.zip
2. Download Undertale Mod Tool  from https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool
3. Legally obtain your GameMaker game files from Steam/GOG/Itch.io
4. Locate the data.win or game.unx file inside the game files and open it using the Undertale Mod Tool and determine the GameMaker version to see which wrapper (.apk/.port) can help to translate the game information appropriately.
5. You can find the game version at the top of the window or under Data -> General Information -> Version

6. Copy the appropriate wrapper version from [here](https://github.com/Damian2809/GMloader-ports/tree/main/gmloader%20wrappers%20(APK))
7. Delete test.apk and rename the wrapper (e.g  rename GMS 2.2.2.302.apk to gamename.apk)
8. Place all your game files (data.win, audiogroup.dat, .ogg file) and folders under /test/assets
9. Edit the gmloader.json to link to the right .apk or .port [You will find More information Here about that](https://github.com/Damian2809/GMloader-ports?tab=readme-ov-file#editing-gmloaderjson-only-for-gmloader-next) 
9. Place Test.sh and /test folder into your ports folder on your device (e.g roms2/ports).
10. Run Test under your ports menu to see if your game works.
11. If the game runs poorly and is does not use a "2024.x.x.x.apk" then try to use gmloader

**If your game works... then it is time to edit your filenames and troubleshoot!**

### **Editing gmloader.json (only for GMLoader-next)**
You will have these Lines in your gmloader.json
"
{
    "save_dir" : "saves",
    "apk_path" : "gamename.apk",
    "show_cursor" : false,
    "disable_controller" : false,
    "force_platform" : "os_windows"
}
"
Change the apk_path to the actual gamename.apk and you may want to mess with some of the other settings

# **First Step: Renaming your folder name, file names and .sh name**
Script Name: Test.sh -> Game Name.sh
Game folder name: /test -> /gamename
Under your gamefolder you need to rename the following 2 files:
test.apk ->gamename.apk
test.gptk -> gamename.gptk

Note: The script should have capital letters (like Port Name.sh ) and must end in .sh , the port directory (Game folder name) should be the same as the containing directory. Usually it is combined into a single word with no space and all in lowercase.

# **Second Step: Editing the .sh file**
![Testsh.png](https://github.com/Damian2809/GMloader-ports/blob/main/images/Testsh.png)
Replace the highlighted parts above with your Game Name and renamed folders and files. The .zip usually has the same name as your game folder name.

## For GMloader-next
The above lines will be replaced as such:

$DATAFILE="test.apk" **→** $DATAFILE="gamename.apk"

"$GPTOKEYB "gmloadernext" -c "test.gptk" & **→** $GPTOKEYB "gmloadernext" -c ./gamename.gptk &"

## For GMLoader-old
The above Lines will be replaced as such:

"$GPTOKEYB "gmloader" -c ./test.gptk & → $GPTOKEYB "gmloader" -c ./gamename.gptk &"

"./gmloader test.apk → ./gmloader gamename.apk"

# **Third Step: Editing the gamename.gptk file**
Kindly refer to https://portmaster.games/gptokeyb-documentation.html

First and foremost, if the GameMaker game has in-built gamepad controls, you may edit all the lines as the following:

![testaptk.png](https://github.com/Damian2809/GMloader-ports/blob/main/images/testgptk.png)

The backslash\" basically means that the input from the .gptk file is empty and hence controls will mainly be gotten from the in-build SDL2 controls available on your handheld.

If your game solely utilizes mouse and keyboard controls, then use the above [link](https://portmaster.games/gptokeyb-documentation.html) to remap the controls appropriately (i.e play the game on your computer first to see the controls in the menu and in-game to decide how to rebind the controls)

# **Forth Step: Test and Troubleshoot**
Join the Portmaster discord server and put a new post under #testing-n-dev and the Portmaster discord community will help you with your port.

There are many games which requires patches or extra coding to help the game run optimally (i.e prevent slowdowns, fix missing sounds)
Some of these Problems already have a Solution so look into [here](https://github.com/Damian2809/GMloader-ports/tree/main/Bugs)


# **Last Step: Making the port available**
